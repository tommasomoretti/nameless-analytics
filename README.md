An open source web analytics platform for power users based on [Google Tag Manager](https://marketingplatform.google.com/intl/it/about/tag-manager/) and [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery). 

Collect, analyze and activate your website data with a free* real-time web analytics suite that respects users privacy.



## TL;DR
### üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - Privacy focused
- **First-party data context**\
Cookies are released from GTM Server-side, in a first-party context and events data are saved in your own Google BigQuery dataset.

- **Privacy by design**\
Choose between three consent tracking modes:
  - Limited Tracking Mode when respect_consent_mode is enabled: track events only when analytics_storage is granted,
  - Full Tracking Mode when respect_consent_mode is disabled: track all events regardless analytics_storage value
  - Anonymous Tracking Mode respect_consent_mode is disabled: track all events with redacted user_id, client_id and session_id when analytics_storage is denied
By default, no PII data are tracked.


### ‚ö°Ô∏è - Performance features
- **Real-time**\
Data ingestion into Google BigQuery is nearly instantaneous and events are available within a couple of seconds.

- **Lightweight and fast**\
The main JavaScript library only weighs a few kB and it's served via CloudFlare CDN. All hits are sent via HTTP POST requests.


### ‚öô - Event tracking features
- **Client-side tracking with custom events**\
