An open-source web analytics platform for power users, based on [Google Tag Manager](https://marketingplatform.google.com/intl/it/about/tag-manager/) and [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery).

Collect, analyze, and activate your website data with a free[^1] real-time digital analytics suite that respects user privacy.

## Main features
Here is a basic schema of how Nameless Analytics works:

![Nameless Analytics schema](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1489c365-ce6e-4109-97e2-91b0debdc91e)


### üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Privacy

- **First-party data context**\
  Cookies are released from GTM Server-side in a first-party context, and event data are saved in your own Google BigQuery dataset.

- **Privacy by design**\
  Choose between three consent tracking modes:
  - **Limited Tracking Mode** (when `respect_consent_mode` is enabled): Track events only when `analytics_storage` is granted.
  - **Full Tracking Mode** (when `respect_consent_mode` is disabled): Track all events regardless of `analytics_storage` value.
  - **Anonymous Tracking Mode** (when `respect_consent_mode` is disabled): Track all events with redacted `user_id`, `client_id`, and `session_id` when `analytics_storage` is denied.

  By default, no PII data are tracked.


### ‚ö°Ô∏è Performances

- **Real-time**\
  Data ingestion into Google BigQuery is nearly instantaneous, and events are available within a couple of seconds.

- **Lightweight and fast**\
  The main JavaScript library only weighs a few kB and is served via CloudFlare CDN. All hits are sent via HTTP POST requests.


### ‚öô Event tracking

- **Client-side tracking**\
  Highly customizable Client-Side Tracker Tag that supports various field types (string, integer, double, and JSON) and accepts custom acquisition URL parameters (it's not mandatory to use UTM parameters).

- **Server-side tracking**\
  All data are written directly to Google BigQuery by the Server-Side Client Tag, which processes requests from the Client-Side Tracker Tag, enriches the content, and stores browser cookies.

- **E-commerce event tracking**\
  Flexible e-commerce data structure that supports ga4 or custom objects.

- **Cross-domain tracking** (üöß beta feature)\
  Track users and sessions across multiple websites.

- **Single Page App tracking**\
  Easily track single-page application page views by customizing the tracker settings.


### üöÄ Send events from (almost) everywhere and log 'em all

- **Measurement protocol**\
  Enhance data tracked from the website with custom requests made from a server or other sources.

- **Event logging**\
  Simplified debugging with event details from the JavaScript console and from Server-Side Google Tag Manager debug view.
