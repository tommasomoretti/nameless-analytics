## Main features
### üíæ Data governance
- **Cloud hosted data**\
  All data is stored in its raw form, exactly as sent from the browser or via the Measurement Protocol, or inserted through the Data Loader script. No pre-processing is applied.

- **Privacy by design**\
  Fully integrated with Google Consent Mode with three tracking modes:
  - **Limited Tracking Mode** (with `respect_consent_mode` enabled): Track events only when `analytics_storage` is granted.
  - **Full Tracking Mode** (with `respect_consent_mode` disabled): Track all events regardless of `analytics_storage` value.
  - **Anonymous Tracking Mode** (with `respect_consent_mode` disabled): Track all events with redacted `user_id`, `client_id`, and `session_id` when `analytics_storage` is denied.

  By default, no PII data are tracked.

- **Respect user rights**\
  Easily delete data if a user makes a deletion request.

- **First-party data context**\
  Cookies are served from GTM Server-side in a first-party context, and user data are saved in your own Google BigQuery dataset.
  

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Performances

- **Real-time**\
  Data ingestion into Google BigQuery is nearly instantaneous, and events are available within a couple of seconds.

- **Lightweight and fast**\
  The main JavaScript library only weighs a few kB and is served via CloudFlare CDN. All hits are sent via HTTP POST requests.


### ‚öô Event tracking

- **Client-side tracking**\
  Highly customizable Client-Side Tracker Tag that supports various field types (string, integer, double, and JSON) and accepts custom acquisition URL parameters (it's not mandatory to use UTM parameters).

- **Server-side tracking**\
  All data are written directly to Google BigQuery by the Server-Side Client Tag, which processes requests from the Client-Side Tracker Tag, enriches the content, and stores browser cookies.

- **E-commerce event tracking**\
  Flexible e-commerce data structure that supports GA4 standards or custom objects.

- **Cross-domain tracking** (üöß beta feature)\
  Track users and sessions across multiple websites.

- **Single Page App tracking**\
  Easily track single-page application page views by customizing the tracker settings.


### üöÄ Send and load events from (almost) everywhere and log 'em all

- **Measurement protocol**\
  Enhance data tracked from the website with custom requests made from a server or other sources.

- **Offline data import**\
  Load data from a structured CSV into the main table effortlessly.

- **Event logging**\
  Simplified debugging with event details from the JavaScript console and from Server-Side Google Tag Manager debug view.
