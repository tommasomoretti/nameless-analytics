An open source web analytics platform for power users based on [Google Tag Manager](https://marketingplatform.google.com/intl/it/about/tag-manager/) and [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery). 

Collect, analyze and activate your website data with a free* real-time web analytics suite that respects users privacy.

## TL;DR
### üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - Privacy focused
- **First-party data context**\
Cookies are released from GTM Server-side, in a first-party context and events data are saved in your own Google BigQuery dataset.

- **Privacy by design**\
You can automatically respects users choises or you can choose to track every event regards users consents. By default, no PII data are tracked.


### ‚ö°Ô∏è - Performance features
- **Real-time**\
Data ingestion into Google BigQuery is nearly instantaneous and events are available within a couple of seconds.

- **Lightweight and fast**\
The main JavaScript library only weighs a fiew kB and it's served via CloudFlare CDN. All hits are sent via HTTP POST requests.


### ‚öô - Event tracking features
- **Custom event tracking**\

- **Single Page App tracking**\
Track single page application page views easily, you can customize the tracker depending on your needs.


### üöÄ - Send events from (almost) everywhere
- **Measurement Protocol**\
Enhance data tracked from website with custom requests made from a server or other sources.  



## Basic requirements
- Google Consent Mode installed on a website
- A client-side Google Tag Manager container installed on a website
- A server-side Google Tag Manager container hosted on App Engine or Cloud Run (Stape.io to be tested)
- A Google BigQuery project

See [Get started section](https://github.com/tommasomoretti/nameless-analytics/blob/main/README.md#get-started) for details about how to setup server-side Google Tag Manager, the BigQuery main table and the whole environment.



## How it works
Here a basic schema and a brief explanation of how Nameless Analytics works.

![Nameless Analytics Schema](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc837ffe-d3bf-4168-a87f-077f9f2ea847)


### Client-side Tracker Tag
When the Client-side Tracker Tag is fired, if the ```respect_consent_mode``` option is enabled, it checks the ```analytics_storage``` status.
- If ```analytics_storage``` is equal to granted, the tag sends the hit to the server-side Google Tag Manager endpoint, with the event name and event parameters configured in the tag.

- If ```analytics_storage``` is equal to denied, the tag waits until consent is granted. If consent is granted (in the context of the same page), all pending tags will be fired.

If the ```respect_consent_mode``` option is disabled, the tag fires regardless of the user's consent.

### Server-side Client Tag
When the server-side Google Tag Manager Client Tag receives the request, it checks if any cookies in there.

| Cookie name                | Example value                                   | Default expiration | Description                                                                                     |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| nameless_analytics_user    | pLQQFjUv7IBJuDA                                 | 400 days           | 15 chars random string                                                                          |
| nameless_analytics_session | pLQQFjUv7IBJuDA_BxEtSZuKR71XL7K-fEErCpUjYPgbVqd | 30 minutes         | nameless_analytics_user + 15 chars random string + current page_id                              |

- If no cookies are present or the ```nameless_analytics_user``` cookie is not set but ```nameless_analytics_session cookie``` is set, the client tag generates generates two values, one for ```nameless_analytics_user``` cookie and one for ```nameless_analytics_session``` cookie), adds these values as event parameters and sets two cookies with the response.

- If the ```nameless_analytics_user``` cookie is set but ```nameless_analytics_session cookie``` is not (session expires), the client tag generates generates only one value for ```nameless_analytics_session``` cookie, adds that value to the hit, as event parameters, set again the same ```nameless_analytics_user``` cookie and set the ```nameless_analytics_session``` cookie with the response.

- If both cookies are present, the tag does not create any new cookies but adds their values to the hit.

After that, the hit will be logged in a BigQuery event date partitioned table.
