An open source web analytics platform for power users based on [Google Tag Manager](https://marketingplatform.google.com/intl/it/about/tag-manager/) and [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery). 

Collect, analyze and activate your website data with a free* real-time web analytics suite that respects users privacy.


## TL;DR
### üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - Privacy focused
- **First-party data context**\
Cookies are released from GTM Server-side, in a first-party context and events data are saved in your own Google BigQuery dataset.

- **Privacy by design**\
Choose between three consent tracking modes:
  - Limited Tracking Mode (when respect_consent_mode is enabled): track events when analytics_storage is granted
  - Full Tracking Mode when (respect_consent_mode is disabled): track all events regardless analytics_storage value
  - Anonymous Tracking Mode (when respect_consent_mode is disabled): track all events with redacted user_id, client_id and session_id when analytics_storage is denied
By default, no PII data are tracked.


### ‚ö°Ô∏è - Performance features
- **Real-time**\
Data ingestion into Google BigQuery is nearly instantaneous and events are available within a couple of seconds.

- **Lightweight and fast**\
Main JavaScript library only weighs a few kB and it's served via CloudFlare CDN. All hits are sent via HTTP POST requests.


### ‚öô - Event tracking features
- **Client-side tracking with custom events**\
Highly customizable Client-side Tracker Tag that supports various field types (string, integer, double, and JSON) and accepts custom acquisition url parameters (it's not mandatory to use UTM parameters).

- **Server-side tracking**\
All data are written directly to Google BigQuery by Server-side Client Tag, which processes requests from the Client-side Tracker Tag, enriches the content and store browser cookies.

- **Ecommerce event tracking**\
Flexible ecommerce data structure that supports custom formats or GA4 ecommerce data structure.  

- **Cross-domain tracking (üöß beta feature)**\
Track users and sessions across multiple websites.

- **Single Page App tracking**\
Track single page application page views easily, you can customize the tracker depending on your needs.


### üöÄ - Send events from (almost) everywhere and log them all
- **Measurement Protocol**\
Enhance data tracked from website with custom requests made from a server or other sources.

- **Event logging**\
Simplified debugging with event details from the Javascript console and from server-side Google Tag Manager debug view.
