An open-source web analytics platform for power users, based on [Google Tag Manager](https://marketingplatform.google.com/intl/it/about/tag-manager/) and [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery).

Collect, analyze, and activate your website data with a free* real-time web analytics suite that respects user privacy.

Here is a basic schema of how Nameless Analytics works:

## TL;DR

### üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Privacy-Focused

- **First-Party Data Context**\
  Cookies are released from GTM Server-side in a first-party context, and event data are saved in your own Google BigQuery dataset.

- **Privacy by Design**\
  Choose between three consent tracking modes:
  - **Limited Tracking Mode** (when `respect_consent_mode` is enabled): Track events when `analytics_storage` is granted.
  - **Full Tracking Mode** (when `respect_consent_mode` is disabled): Track all events regardless of `analytics_storage` value.
  - **Anonymous Tracking Mode** (when `respect_consent_mode` is disabled): Track all events with redacted `user_id`, `client_id`, and `session_id` when `analytics_storage` is denied.

  By default, no PII data are tracked.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Performance Features

- **Real-Time**\
  Data ingestion into Google BigQuery is nearly instantaneous, and events are available within a couple of seconds.

- **Lightweight and Fast**\
  The main JavaScript library only weighs a few kB and is served via CloudFlare CDN. All hits are sent via HTTP POST requests.

### ‚öô Event Tracking Features

- **Client-Side Tracking**\
  Highly customizable Client-Side Tracker Tag that supports various field types (string, integer, double, and JSON) and accepts custom acquisition URL parameters (it's not mandatory to use UTM parameters).

- **Server-Side Tracking**\
  All data are written directly to Google BigQuery by the Server-Side Client Tag, which processes requests from the Client-Side Tracker Tag, enriches the content, and stores browser cookies.

- **E-commerce Event Tracking**\
  Flexible e-commerce data structure that supports custom formats or GA4 e-commerce data structure.

- **Cross-Domain Tracking** (üöß beta feature)\
  Track users and sessions across multiple websites.

- **Single Page App Tracking**\
  Easily track single-page application page views by customizing the tracker settings.

### üöÄ Send Events from (almost) everywhere and log 'em all

- **Measurement Protocol**\
  Enhance data tracked from the website with custom requests made from a server or other sources.

- **Event Logging**\
  Simplified debugging with event details from the JavaScript console and from Server-Side Google Tag Manager debug view.
