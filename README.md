## Main features
### 💾 Data governance
- **First-party data context**
  
  Cookies are served from GTM Server-side in a first-party context.

- **Privacy by design**

  Fully integrated with Google Consent Mode with two tracking modes:
  - Respect user consents:
    - **Limited Tracking Mode** (with `respect_consent_mode` enabled): Track events only when `analytics_storage` is granted.
  - Do not respect user consents:
    - **Full Tracking Mode** (with `respect_consent_mode` disabled): Track all events regardless of `analytics_storage` value.
    - **Anonymous Tracking Mode** (with `respect_consent_mode` disabled): Track all events with redacted `user_id`, `client_id`, and `session_id` when `analytics_storage` is denied.

  By default, no PII data are tracked.

- **Cloud hosted data**
  
  All data is stored in its raw form in a Google BigQuery dataset, exactly as sent from the browser, via the Measurement Protocol or inserted through the Data Loader script. No pre-processing is applied.
  
- **Raw data**
  
  No sampling or pre processing, only raw data. Use standard tables or make custom tables that fit all then needs in Google BigQuery, without limits.

  No pre-built interface, use any BI tool that connects with BigQuery such as Google Looker, Google Looker Studio, Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, Apache Superset, Grafana, Redash, Mode Analytics, etc... to create reports that truly fit the needs.
  

### ⚡️ Performances
- **Real-time**
  
  Data ingestion into Google BigQuery is nearly instantaneous, and events are available within a couple of seconds.

- **Lightweight and fast**
  
  The main JavaScript library only weighs a few kB and is served via CloudFlare CDN. All hits are sent via HTTP POST requests.


### ⚙️ Event tracking

- **Client-side tracking**
  
  Highly customizable Client-Side Tracker Tag that supports various field types (string, integer, double, and JSON) and accepts custom acquisition URL parameters (it's not mandatory to use UTM parameters). Easily track single-page application page views by customizing the tracker settings.

- **Server-side tracking**
  
  All data are written directly to Google BigQuery by the Server-Side Client Tag, which processes requests from the Client-Side Tracker Tag, enriches the content, and stores browser cookies.

- **E-commerce event tracking**
  
  Flexible e-commerce data structure that supports GA4 standards or custom objects.

- **Cross-domain tracking** (🚧 beta feature)
  
  Track users and sessions across multiple websites.

- **Measurement protocol tracking**
  
  Enhance data tracked from the website with custom requests made from a server or other sources.

- **Offline data import**
  
  Load data from a structured CSV into the main table effortlessly.

- **Event logging**
  
  Simplified debugging with event details from the JavaScript console and from Server-Side Google Tag Manager debug view.
