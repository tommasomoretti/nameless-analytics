# Nameless Analytics Documentation - TO DO List

1. [x] **Master Guide / Quick Start**: Add a "Quick Start" section to the `nameless-analytics` repo, likely under "Get started". This will serve as the Master Guide for the entire project.
2. [x] **Monorepo Consolidation**: Merged GTM examples and SQL reporting tables into the main `nameless-analytics` repository for better maintainability (Opzione C).
3. [x] **License Setup**: Create LICENSE files for all repositories and update READMEs (MIT License).
4. [ ] **Error/Edge Case Management**: Rethink the management of errors and edge cases from scratch (currently in `nameless-analytics-client-side-tracker-tag`). (IN PROGRESS)

*Note: Do not consider the task finished until the user says "procediamo con la prossima attività". Only one activity at a time.*
