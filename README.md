## Basic requirements
- Google Consent Mode installed on a website
- A client-side Google Tag Manager container installed on a website
- A server-side Google Tag Manager container hosted on App Engine or Cloud Run (Stape.io to be tested)
- A Google BigQuery dataset with write permissions

See [Get started section](https://github.com/tommasomoretti/nameless-analytics/blob/main/README.md#get-started) for details about how to setup server-side Google Tag Manager, the BigQuery main table and the whole environment.



## How it works
Here a basic schema and explanation of how Nameless Analytics works.

![Nameless Analytics Schema](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc837ffe-d3bf-4168-a87f-077f9f2ea847)



### Client-side Tracker Tag
When the Client-side Tracker Tag is loaded, if the ```respect_consent_mode``` option is enabled, the first tag that should be fired, checks the ```analytics_storage``` status.
- If ```analytics_storage``` is equal to granted, the tag sends the hit to the server-side Google Tag Manager endpoint, with the event name and event parameters configured in the tag.

- If ```analytics_storage``` is equal to denied, the tag waits until consent is granted. If consent is granted (in the context of the same page), all pending tags will be fired.

If the ```respect_consent_mode``` option is disabled, the tag fires regardless of the user's consent.

#### Cross Domain
If ```enable_cross_domain_tracking``` option is enabled, the client-side tag will set a javascript event listener on every link click. 
  - When a user clicks on a link with a authorized domain for cross-domain, a javascript event listener sends a ```get_user_data``` request to the server. The server responds with the two cookie values and the javascript event listener decorates the URL with a parameter named ```na_id```. After that, the user is redirected to the destination website.
  - When the user lands on the destination website, the first tag that fires checks if there is a ```na_id``` parameter in the URL. If it is present, the hit will contain a ```cross_domain_id``` parameter, the server-side Client Tag will add it to the request and set back the cookies with those values.

    When ```enable_cross_domain_tracking``` option is enabled, ```analytics_storage``` is granted and a user clicks on an authorized link:

    When ```enable_cross_domain_tracking``` option is enabled, ```analytics_storage``` is granted and a user clicks on not autorized link:
    
    <img width="1263" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-25 alle 13 45 43" src="https://github.com/tommasomoretti/nameless-analytics/assets/29273232/207ce2cf-5a09-4e5f-a0c0-1450e4065631">
    
    When ```enable_cross_domain_tracking``` option is enabled, ```analytics_storage``` is granted and a user clicks on internal link:
    
    <img width="1262" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-25 alle 13 48 01" src="https://github.com/tommasomoretti/nameless-analytics/assets/29273232/e5152e8f-c757-4718-8e94-5dd28df19564">
    
    When ```enable_cross_domain_tracking``` option is enabled, ```analytics_storage``` is not granted and a user clicks on any link, no link decoration happens but the logs are still present in the console like above. 
    
    <img width="1263" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-26 alle 15 41 31" src="https://github.com/tommasomoretti/nameless-analytics/assets/29273232/1ee8a621-cf00-47b9-9c3a-dff38ac77e2a">
    <img width="1264" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-26 alle 15 42 51" src="https://github.com/tommasomoretti/nameless-analytics/assets/29273232/2d59516f-c8dc-4c20-8e41-8f2fc505b0e7">
    <img width="1264" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-26 alle 15 43 42" src="https://github.com/tommasomoretti/nameless-analytics/assets/29273232/e32d530a-bdb5-479c-9da9-7ec669a03cf5">

If ```enable_cross_domain_tracking``` option is disabled, the client-side tag will not set any listener.


### Server-side Client Tag
When the Server-side Tag Manager Client Tag receives the request, it checks if any cookies in there.

| Cookie name                | Example value                       | Default expiration | Description                                                                                     |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| nameless_analytics_user    | 3135061696                          | 400 days           | Random number between 1000000000 and 9999999999                                                 |
| nameless_analytics_session | 3135061696_3983471069-1722607958646 | 30 minutes         | nameless_analytics_user + Random number between 1000000000 and 9999999999 + Last event timestamp|

- If no cookies are present or the ```nameless_analytics_user``` cookie is not set but ```nameless_analytics_session cookie``` is set, the client tag generates generates two values, one for ```nameless_analytics_user``` cookie and one for ```nameless_analytics_session``` cookie), adds these values as event parameters and sets two cookies with the response.

- If the ```nameless_analytics_user``` cookie is set but ```nameless_analytics_session cookie``` is not (session expires), the client tag generates generates only one value for ```nameless_analytics_session``` cookie, adds that value to the hit, as event parameters, set again the same ```nameless_analytics_user``` cookie and set the ```nameless_analytics_session``` cookie with the response.

- If both cookies are present, the tag does not create any new cookies but adds their values to the hit.

After that, the hit will be logged in a BigQuery event date partitioned table.
