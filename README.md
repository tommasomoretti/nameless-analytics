# Technical architecture and data flow
The system mainly consists of a highly customizable client-side tracker that captures user interactions and sends event data to a server-side GTM container, where user and session IDs are managed using secure cookies (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict). The data is enriched and stored in Firestore (for user and session data) and in BigQuery (for detailed events), without sampling or preprocessing.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea15a5f1-b456-4d85-a116-42e54c4073cd" alt="Nameless Analytics schema"/>

The data flow in Nameless Analytics starts from the GTM Client-Side Tracker Tag, which can be configured to track all hits or only those where consent has been granted. It can send standard events like page_view as well as custom events, supporting Single Page Applications, ecommerce data in JSON format and cross-domain tracking.

Events are sent to the GTM Server-Side Client Tag, which handles user and session identification, enriches the data and saves it in real-time to both Firestore and BigQuery.

Data is stored across two Google Cloud systems: Firestore holds user and session data with real-time updates, while BigQuery stores detailed event data and ecommerce information. Tables are organized and indexed to enable fast and complex analyses.

Nameless Analytics provides predefined SQL functions to simplify queries on users, sessions, pages, ecommerce transactions, consents, and GTM performance, facilitating integration with BI tools such as Google Looker Studio or Power BI for customized visualizations and reports.

Additionally, Nameless Analytics supports a streaming protocol that allows sending events from other server-side sources to the Nameless Analytics Server-Side Client Tag.

The platform also offers JavaScript utilities to retrieve cookies, browser details, consent status, and to format timestamps.
